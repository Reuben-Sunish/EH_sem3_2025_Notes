## 1. Middleware
- Software layer that sits between the operating system and applications.  
- Provides common services like communication, authentication, and data management.  
- Examples: Database middleware, message queues, API gateways.

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
- A type of cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.  
- Victims believe they are communicating directly with each other.  
- Common techniques: ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, or compromised Wi-Fi networks.

## 3. Using Proxies to Capture Traffic
- Proxies act as intermediaries between a browser and the target server.  
- They can be used to monitor, analyze, or manipulate web traffic.  
- Tools like **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** help capture and modify requests/responses.

## 4. OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- A globally recognized list of the most critical security risks for web applications.  
- Current categories include:  
  - Broken Access Control  
  - Cryptographic Failures  
  - Injection (SQL, Command, etc.)  
  - Insecure Design  
  - Security Misconfiguration  
  - Vulnerable and Outdated Components  
  - Identification and Authentication Failures  
  - Software and Data Integrity Failures  
  - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures  
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## 5. Wireshark (on Kali Linux)
- A network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets in real time.  
- Useful for troubleshooting, monitoring, and detecting malicious activity.  
- On Kali Linux, it can be used to analyze traffic during penetration testing.  
- Supports filtering to focus on specific protocols or IP addresses.  


# Flipper Zero

A **portable multi-tool device for hackers and security enthusiasts**.  
Looks like a Tamagotchi-style gadget but used for digital systems.  

---

## Features
- **RFID/NFC** → Reads & emulates access cards (e.g., office badges, metro cards).  
- **Radio (Sub-1 GHz)** → Interacts with garage doors, car keys, IoT devices.  
- **Infrared (IR)** → Works like a universal remote (TVs, ACs, etc.).  
- **USB Mode** → Can act as keyboard, mouse, or emulate USB devices.  
- **GPIO Pins** → Connect hardware modules and sensors.  

---

## Use Cases
- **Pentesting** → Test RFID cards, wireless protocols, system security.  
- **Fun Hacks** → Control TVs, prank devices, experiment with IoT.  
- **Learning** → Great for exploring hardware and radio security.  

---

## Important Note
- Legal to **own**, but actions like cloning access cards or tampering with systems you don’t own are **illegal**.
